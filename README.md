# InsightPing

InsightPing is a Slack-native assistant that summarizes the most important insights from your team’s tools — GitHub, Jira, Intercom, Asana, Linear, Notion, Trello — and pings you once a day with:

- What changed
- What’s blocked
- What needs your attention

Simple. Fast. Actionable. No extra logins, no dashboards to drown in.
